<h1> AuroraPlus </h1>
<p>
<h2>Hello and welcome to the Aurora+ project page.</h2>

AuroraPlus is an awesome open-source server monitoring tool. It’s created by two Dutch developers with passion and excitement. 
</p>
<h2>What operating systems does Aurora+ support?</h2>
<p>
Aurora is designed to work on almost all operating systems. It runs on (most) linux distributions, Windows, and macOS.
</p>
<h2>What are the requirements for Aurora?</h2>
<p>
Aurora+ is fully written in python, and logically needs it to survive.
Aurora+ makes use of the following python libraries (Which are supported cross-platform).
<ul>
   <li>Psutil</li>
   <li>Requests</li>
</ul>
The dashboard and API are build on the famous Django framework, so you’ll be needing that too.
</p>

<h2>What can Aurora+ do for me?<h2>
<p>
Aurora is limited by your own knowledge <small>(and ours).</small> We are writing a plugin compatible version as we write.
Aurora will standard monitor: 
<ul>
<li>Network</li>
<li>Disk load (Read/Write)</li>
<li>Disk usage (Used Memory)</li>
<li>RAM usage</li>
<li>Latency (From dashboard app to agent)</li>
</ul>

These are at the moment just a few, but with many more to come!
In version 1.4 Aurora will be capable of alerting you when your server is hitting it's limits! (Which you can dynamically set).
</p>

Here are a few screenshots for the current version (1.2) We are already working on 1.3 and 1.4.
